# Enso API Rust Client

This Rust library provides an interface to the Enso API, which offers a unified way to interact with various DeFi primitives. The library aims to simplify the integration of Enso's features into Rust applications by abstracting the underlying HTTP requests and responses into more manageable Rust constructs.

## Features

- **Simplified Access**: Easy-to-use functions that correspond to API endpoints.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Built-in support for asynchronous programming.

This README provides instructions on how to set up and use this Rust client, along with examples and configuration tips.

## Getting Started

Below, you'll find the necessary steps to include this client in your project, authenticate with the Enso API, and begin making requests to DeFi protocols.
